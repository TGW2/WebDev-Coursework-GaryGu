# Unit 9 Reflection

In Unit 9, I was introduced to JavaScript and how it can make websites more interactive and dynamic. I learned that JavaScript is a programming language used to add behavior to websites, such as responding to user actions like clicking buttons. I practiced writing simple JavaScript code to display messages and learned how to link my code to an HTML button, which helped me understand how users can interact with the page.

I also learned how to access HTML elements and their attributes using JavaScript. This included using **document.getElementById()** to find elements and then changing their content using the **innerHTML** property. Being able to change text and interact with HTML through JavaScript helped me see how I can make my web pages more engaging and functional.

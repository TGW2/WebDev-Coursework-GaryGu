# Unit 11 Reflection

Throughout this course, I’ve gained a solid understanding of web design—starting from its history and basic structure to modern practices. Learning how the Internet and websites work helped me understand the big picture of how we connect digitally today. I really enjoyed inspecting websites I use often and seeing how they are built behind the scenes using developer tools.

My favorite part was creating my own web pages with HTML and then using CSS to style them. Adding color, layout, and font styles made the sites come to life. Learning about the design thinking process taught me to always keep the user in mind. It reminded me that web design is not just about how things look, but also how they work for real people.

JavaScript was challenging but exciting. I felt proud when I made interactive buttons and pop-up messages. Exploring the UN Global Goals helped me see how web design can be used to support meaningful causes. I also learned how to make my website more accessible, such as adding alt text for images, which is important for making the web open to everyone.

Now, I’m thinking about my next steps. I’m most interested in front-end development and UX/UI design because I enjoy making websites look great and work well for users. In the future, I want to take more advanced courses, start working on real projects, and maybe even look for internships. This course helped me build a strong foundation and made me excited to keep learning more about web design.

    <h1>Global Goals</h1>
    <b>Recognition of Expired and Unmet Millennium Development Goals (MDGs):</b>
    <div class="MDGs">The SDGs followed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were set in 2000 with targets for 2015. While significant progress was made in some areas, many goals were not fully met. The SDGs were designed to continue and expand upon this work, addressing the shortcomings and unfinished business of the MDGs.</div>
    
    <b>Increased Global Challenges:</b>
    <div class="IGC">Despite progress, many areas remained unresolved and unmet. Areas of concern such as poverty, climate change, general health and education, and economic instability escalated at an ever increasing rate.</div>

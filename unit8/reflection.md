# Unit 8 Reflection

In this unit, I learned how to use CSS to improve the structure and appearance of my web pages. I practiced styling with the **`<div>`** element and the HTML class attribute, which helped me organize my content more clearly and make it look better. I was also introduced to the CSS box model and the **position** property, where I experimented with the five different types of positioning: static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky. I saw how changing the **top**, **bottom**, **left**, and **right** values affects how elements appear on the page.

I also learned about the CSS **display** property and its different values, such as **none**, **inline**, **block**, **inline-block**, **flex**, and **grid**. Now I understand how to use these values to control how elements are laid out on a page, and I used this knowledge to improve the design of my own website.

Finally, I explored the ideas of responsive and adaptive design. I learned how to code for both types and why it is important to make websites that work on all devices. I compared the two methods and thought about which one fits my website best. Overall, this unit helped me understand the structure behind good web design and how to make my pages more user-friendly and professional.

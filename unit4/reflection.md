# Unit 4 Reflection

In this unit, I learned how to use HTML attributes to add more meaning to web elements, such as using title, lang, and alt to improve accessibility and user experience. I also explored different types of HTML lists and how to present them in various ways, which helped organize content clearly. Embedding and sizing images using absolute and relative links was challenging at first, especially understanding how file paths work. I overcame this by experimenting with different folder structures and reviewing examples. Accessibility was a new concept for me, but I now understand its importance in web design. This unit showed me that small details like alt text can make a big difference. Overall, this unit helped me build more user-friendly and organized websites, which is essential for any web development project.

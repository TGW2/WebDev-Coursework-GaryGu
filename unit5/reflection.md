# Unit 5 Reflection

In Unit 5, I learned the basics of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and how it helps improve the design and appearance of websites. CSS allows web designers to change fonts, colors, spacing, and layouts, making web pages more visually appealing and easier to read. I also learned how to use CSS to change the size of images, and I practiced resizing images on a client’s web page using different CSS properties like width, height, and max-width.

Another key part of the lesson was understanding the three main types of CSS: inline, internal, and external. I learned that inline CSS is written directly in an HTML element, internal CSS is written in the style tag in the head section, and external CSS is in a separate .css file. Web designers choose between them based on how much control they want and how reusable the styles need to be.

Finally, I applied an internal style sheet to a client’s web page, which helped me understand how styles are added and how CSS affects the whole structure of the page. Overall, this unit helped me understand how powerful and important CSS is for web design.

# Unit 10 Reflection

In Unit 10, I learned how to organize a multi-page website using a clear folder and file structure. I now understand how to keep HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files in the right places, which makes building and managing a website much easier. I also created a navigation bar that links to different pages like Home, About, and Contact. This helped me understand how to connect pages and improve the user experience.

I practiced building both the HTML and CSS parts of the navigation bar and applied what I learned to my own client website. I thought carefully about my design choices, trying to make the website clean, simple, and easy to use. I also focused on giving feedback to users and making sure the website was accessible to everyone.

Finally, I learned how to review and evaluate my website, looking for ways to improve it before showing it to others. This unit helped me build more professional websites and reminded me how important good design and structure are.

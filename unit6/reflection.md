# Unit 6 Reflection

In Unit 6, I learned how important feedback and iteration are in the design process. I practiced gathering feedback from classmates and my client, and used their suggestions to improve the design of the clientâ€™s web page. I also learned how to add links using both absolute and relative paths, and how to style them for a better look. Adding a favicon to the browser tab and using the CSS border property helped me make the page more polished. I also used the HTML 'span' tag to style specific words or sections of text. Overall, this unit helped me improve both the technical and design aspects of web development, and I feel more confident making changes based on real feedback.

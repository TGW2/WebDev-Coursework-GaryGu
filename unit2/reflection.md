# Unit 2 Reflection
In this unit, I learned the basic ideas of product design, especially how function, look, and user experience must work together. I practiced noticing what design choices were made in different websites and why. At first, it was hard to tell the difference between UI and UX, but after checking real examples and using the Design Thinking Process, it became clearer. Reviewing the steps of Design Thinking helped me understand how to design with users in mind. This lesson showed me that good design is not just about looks, but also about how easy and enjoyable something is to use. It connects well with my client project and future web design work.

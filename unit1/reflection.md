# Unit 1 Reflection
In this unit, I learned about the history of the Internet and how it grew from ARPANET into the web we use today. I found it interesting that packet switching and TCP/IP made it possible for networks to talk to each other. Learning about pioneers like Elizabeth Fienler helped me see how early work still impacts the Internet now. I also practiced coding the basic structure of a web page using HTML, including titles, headers, and paragraphs. A challenge I faced was remembering the correct tags and how to format them properly, but I overcame it by reviewing examples and using comments to stay organized. Understanding how websites work, from servers to browsers, showed me how everything connects. This lesson helped me build a solid foundation for web development and made me realize how powerful creating a website can be in reaching people all over the world.
